#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software Engineering is a systematic application of engineering principles, tools and methods in the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. it involves several activities such as writing instructions (codes) for computers, building apps, games and solving real-world problems through technology.
Software Engineering is essential in the technology industry as it involves the creation of software application systems that power various aspects of our lives such as healthcare, banking and entertainment.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C).
2. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements - This phase involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design - Creating designs of software architecture and user Interface.
3. Implementation - Writing codes and building a software according to the requirements.
4. Testing - Conducting tests to ensure software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment - This involves releasing the software to the users/customers.
6. Maintenance - Providing ongoing support, updates and relevant enhancements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology
Waterfall has distinct phases (deign, testing, implementation) flowing down like a waterfall. This method is highly structured, making it suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes.
Example Scenario for Waterfall:
Developing software for regulatory systems like banking applications, where requirements are fixed and compliance is critical.

Agile Methodology
Agile, on the other hand, is an iterative and flexible approach that focuses on collaboration, flexibility and responds to change. Agile promotes collaboration, adaptability, and customer involvement, making it ideal for projects with evolving requirements.
Example Scenario for Agile:
Developing a mobile application with frequent feature updates and changing user requirements.

Contrast

1. Flexibility: Agile allows changes at any stage, whereas Waterfall discourages changes after initial planning.
2. Customer Involvement: Agile actively involves customers throughout the process, while Waterfall engages them mainly at the beginning and end.
3. Delivery: Agile delivers functional components in stages, while Waterfall delivers the entire product at the end.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - they are responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assuarance Engineer - Responsible in ensuring software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project manager - Responsible in overseeing the planning, execution and the delivery of software projects within the required timelined and with the system requirements.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide code editor, debugger, compiler, and automation tools to improve productivity. Features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and refactoring help developers write efficient code. Debugging tools allow for early detection and correction of errors. Examples include;  VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and PyCharm. 
Version Control systems (VCS) on the other hand, tracks source code changes, enabling collaboration and version management. It ensures backup, history tracking, and conflict resolution in team projects. Examples include; Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
2. Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
3. Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: 
effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular 
reassessment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing - testing individual components or modules of software.
2. Integration Testing - testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
3. system testing - Testing the entire siftware system as a whole.
4. Acceptance testing - Testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.                                                                                                         
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs (prompts) to effectively interact with AI models and achieve desired outputs. It involves structuring queries in a way that maximizes clarity, specificity, and relevance, ensuring that AI-generated responses are accurate and useful.
Effective prompt engineering improves efficiency by reducing the need for multiple revisions or clarifications, saving time and effort. It also enhances AIâ€™s ability to perform complex tasks such as summarization, translation, and code generation

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Write about software engineering
Improved Prompt: Write a 500-word article on how software engineering is transforming the healthcare industry, focusing on its benefits, challenges, and future potential.
The improved prompt is effective because it provides clarity, focus, and direction, making it easier to produce relevant and high-quality content. It specifies the topic (software engineering in healthcare), the scope (its benefits, challenges, and future potential), and the length (500 words).
